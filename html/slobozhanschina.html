The name comes from the Cossack settlements - "Slobid", which had their own self-government and were released from duties (so-called "freedom"). Slobozhanshchyna bordered on the west with the Hetmanate, on the south with Zaporozhye and the possessions of the Crimean Khanate, on the east with the Don, on the north with the Moscow region. Within modern limits, it covers the central-southern part of Sumy region, Kharkiv region, the northern part of Luhansk region and the north-eastern part of Donetsk region, western, central, eastern, southern parts of Belgorod, southern parts of Voronezh and Kursk regions.<br><br></p><p></p><p></p></div></h1></div><div class="col-1"></div><div class="col-6"><div class="img-introduction"><img class="img1_introduction" src="../img/harkiv2.jpg"></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="fact1" class="scroll-to"><div class="fact1"><div class="container"><div class="title_fact1"><div class="row"><div class="col-6"><div class="img-fact1"><img class="img1_fact1" src="../img/harkiv4.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-6"><h1><b>Strelka Square</b></h1><div class="text_fact1"><br><br><p>Strelka Square is located in the delta of the city's two main rivers, Kharkiv and Lopan. The square was laid out at this place before the revolution. It has been in desolation for a long time. And only recently the square was completely restored. Numerous trees create a pleasant shade and protect from the noise of the big city. Along the entire park there is an embankment paved with paving slabs. The strict promenade is decorated with alleys with flowers and comfortable benches. It's nice to spend time with family and friends, make new acquaintances. Playful music is often played in the park. Then this place acquires a special charm. In the evening, the square is shrouded in a romantic fog of street lamps. The most beautiful places in Kharkov are hard to find.<br><br></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="fact2-info" class="scroll-to"><div class="fact2"><div class="container"><div class="title_fact2"><div class="row"><div class="col-5"><h1 data-uw-styling-context="true"><b>The Holy Trinity Izmailovsky Cathedral</b></h1><div class="text_fact2"><br><br><p>The Holy Trinity Izmailovsky Cathedral was built in 1828-1835 for the Izmailovsky regiment, which did not know defeat on the battlefield, but ordinary citizens were also its parishioners. The cathedral is crowned with a wooden dome with gilded stars (280 stars on the central dome and 208 on the small ones). In the 19th century, the temple kept banners, flags from ships, guns and keys to cities - trophies of the Izmailovsky regiment, which participated in the Battle of Borodino, the Crimean War of 1853-1856, the Russian-Turkish war of 1877-1878, during which the Balkan Slavic peoples were liberated ... In 1938, the temple was closed, there were warehouses for a long time. In the 1990s, renovations began, in 2006 there was a fire that destroyed the original dome, and only in 2008 the restoration work was completed.<br><br></p><p></p></div></div><div class="col-6"><div class="img-fact2"><img class="img1_fact2" src="../img/cymuu2.jpg"></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="footer_row"><a href="#top"><img src="../img/up.png" width="20%"></a></div></div></footer></div></body></html>
