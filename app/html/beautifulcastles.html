        Ukraine is an ideal place for history lovers who like to visit such historical places as magnificent castles.
        <br>
        <br>
        Castles are perhaps the most interesting objects left in Ukraine's turbulent history. In total, there are more than a hundred of them, but there are few that correspond to the majority's idea of ​​the castle - the rest are in ruins. Some fell in violent military battles, others - did not spare man and time. How many foundations of village houses in Podillya are made of rubble from majestic fortresses… How many roads are paved and mounds are bricked… Some castles are so mutilated that without a reconstructed image it is difficult to guess what they once were
        <br>
        <br>
        Ukraine invites you to visit fantastic historical places that will appeal to those who are interested in history.

        This is the movie star castle - the main medieval castle of Soviet films. La Rochelle, Torkilston, Mott - than he just was not in the movies. The Soviet super-crane operator Bortko decided to make it Dubna Castle, because the real Dubna Castle is not so kinogenic. Therefore, the Cossacks in "Taras Bulba" stormed the "Polish" castle, which was actually Moldovan-Turkish. Khotyn was never stormed by the Cossacks, but defended heroically, led by the great Hetman Sagaidachny.

        In the middle of a wide plain, which is the valley of the river Latoritsa, in the southwestern part of Mukachevo, a mountain rises alone. The top of the mountain is crowned by the towers of the ancient castle. There are few monuments like this in Ukraine.

        Rusyns-Ukrainians, Hungarians, Wallachians, Austrians and other peoples for almost a thousand years of history of the fortress shed sweat and blood in its mighty walls. Hundreds of assaults and sieges survived Palanok. Many times it changed its owners, completed and rebuilt. From the end of the 18th century, Palanok served as an Austrian prison, and in the Soviet period there was a vocational school.
