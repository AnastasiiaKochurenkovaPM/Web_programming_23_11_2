Svityaz is something like the sea, in windy weather the waves here reach a height of one and a half meters… The best natural tourist attraction of Volyn is Lake Svityaz, which is located near the village of Shatsk, the center of the district restored in 1993. It is a part of Shatsky lakes, a group of more than 30 lakes in the north-western part of the Luboml district of the Volyn region, in the interfluve of the Pripyat and Western Bug rivers. They like to compare this lake with Lake Baikal. Of course, the scale is not the same, but here the depths are quite significant: there are underwater "holes" at 32, 37, 38 and even 58.4 meters. Off the coast Svityaz is mostly shallow. You can walk one and a half hundred meters until the water reaches the chest. In windless weather, the water warms up quickly, so parents and children are happy to rest here.<br><br></p><p></p></div></div><div class="col-6"><div class="img-fact2"><img class="img1_fact2" src="../img/volyn9jpg.jpg"></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="fact3" class="scroll-to"><div class="fact3"><div class="container"><div class="title_fact3"><div class="row"><div class="col-6"><div class="img-fact3"><img class="img1_fact3" src="../img/volyn10.jpg"> <img class="img2_fact3" src="../img/volyn11.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-6"><h1><b>Tunnel of Love</b><br></h1><div class="text_fact3"><br><br><p>Regions of Ukraine are abundant with charming romantic places that attract attention with their natural beauty and originality. But one of the most popular and amazing places is the Tunnel of Love near the town of Klevan in Rivne region. The 5-kilometre green corridor, created by trees lined up in an arch of perfect round shape, and the railway between became the main tourist attraction of Volyn, is the object of constant pilgrimage for couples in love and travellers. You can go for a walk to the tunnel at any time of year, but it is better in summer or autumn, when nature paints the leaves in incredible colours and shades, from green to gold and crimson. In the tunnel, lights and shadows play in a peculiar way and photographers adore this place.<br><br>There are many interesting legends about the tunnel. According to one of them, this green corridor existed for several centuries, and once became a refuge for a couple of young people in love – fugitives from Klevan Castle. Another version is even more interesting, telling about a young Polish engineer who fell in love with a girl from Klevan and built a railway directly across the forest to shorten the road from Orzhev, where he lived, to his beloved woman. Eventually, they went different ways, and locals say that these people carried love throughout their lives. An incredible story!<br></p><p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="footer_row"><a href="#top"><img src="../img/up.png" width="20%"></a></div></div></footer></div></body></html>
