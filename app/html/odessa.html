                    Odessa is one of the most important cultural centers of Ukraine. 
                    There are a lot of theaters and museums that have a long history. 
                    Many cultural figures were born and grew in this city: pianists Emil Gilels and Svyatoslav Richter, violinist David Oistrakh, singers Leonid Utesov and Valery Obodzinsky, composer Oskar Feltsman, actors, writers, artists.
                    The magnificent opera house is Odessa’s piece de resistance and was conceived by the Viennese partners Fellner & Helmer in the 1880s.
                    Fellner & Helmer contributed dozens of opera houses across Central and Eastern Europe, but they looked back on Odessa’s as their masterwork.
                    If you want to know the finer details of its Academic architecture and technical specifications you could take a daytime tour, but nothing beats coming to an opera or ballet performance.

                    Running horizontally across the city for almost a kilometre, Deribasivska Street is Odessa’s beating heart. 
                    Whether you’re shopping, dining or sightseeing you’ll keep finding yourself on this dynamic artery.
                    Deribasivska Street is named after one of Odessa’s founders, the Neapolitan José de Ribas, and you can find his statue on the eastern end of the street.
                    The western half was pedestrianised in 1984 and has long lines of 19th-century and early-20th-century mansions.
                    In summer this half of the street is a blur of sightseers, buskers and other street artists, and there are long cafe and restaurant terraces where you can take it all in.
