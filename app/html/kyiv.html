                            Kyiv, also spelled Kiev, Kyyiv, Russian Kiyev, chief city and capital of Ukraine. A port on the Dnieper (Dnipro) River and a large railroad junction, it is a city with an ancient and proud history. 
                            As the centre of Kyivan (Kievan) Rus, the first eastern Slavic state, 1,000 years ago, it acquired the title “Mother of Rus Cities.” 
                            It was severely damaged during World War II, but by the mid-1950s it had been restored, and in the second half of the 20th century it enjoyed a well-developed economic and cultural life. 
                            The independence of Ukraine from the Soviet Union in 1991 renewed Kyiv’s status as a major European capital. Pop.

                        The city stands on the Dnieper River just below its confluence with the Desna and 591 miles (951 km) from its mouth in the Black Sea. 
                        The original location was on the high and steep right (western) bank, which rises above the river in an imposing line of bluffs culminating in Batyyeva Hill, 330 feet (100 metres) above mean river level. This precipitous and wooded bank, topped by the golden domes and spires of churches and bell towers and by high-rise apartment buildings, makes the city an attractive and impressive sight from across the Dnieper. 
                        Since World War II, Kyiv has extended onto the wide, low, and flat floodplain on the left (eastern) bank.

                    This Baroque palace is the official ceremonial home for the President of Ukraine. 
                    After a fire destroyed the first structure, Alexander II had the palace reconstructed in 1870, following the model of the old drawings. 
                    The pale blue exterior lends a dreamy quality to the magnificent architecture.
                    Inside, visitors will find a collection of artwork by Ukrainian masters, as well as cultural and historic treasures. 
                    The surrounding landscaped gardens are a nice place for contemplation.

                    There is a small entry fee charged, but visitors could easily spend several hours here if they are looking for a green space to walk and enjoy the outdoors.
