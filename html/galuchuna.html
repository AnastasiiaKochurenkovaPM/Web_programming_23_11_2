One of the most interesting exhibits in Zolochiv Castle are stones with encrypted inscriptions. Inscriptions date from the end of XIV - the beginning. XV century, have no analogues, not yet reported. The stones were brought from the outskirts of Zolochev - the village of Novosilky.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="fact2-info" class="scroll-to"><div class="fact2"><div class="container"><div class="title_fact2"><div class="row"><div class="col-5"><h1 data-uw-styling-context="true"><b>Dzhurynsky waterfall</b></h1><div class="text_fact2"><br><br><p>Dzhurynsky waterfall, which is part of the Dniester Canyon National Natural Park, is considered one of the most picturesque and interesting places in the Ternopil region.
