Ancient origin and historical development fill it with special charm and attraction for people who are interested in Bukovyna. The first written record of the town is found in the manuscripts of Moldavian landlord Alexander the Kind, issued to the merchants from Lviv on October 8, 1408. Every year this date is celebrated as an official townâ€™s birthday. From the middle of XIX to the beginning of XX centuries numerous architectural monuments were constructed becoming a real glory of the town: Town Hall (1848); the building of Post-Office (1855); Armenian Church (1875); Jewish Synagogue (1877); Music and Drama Theatre (1905); Palace of Justice (1906); the building of Railway Station (1908).<br><br></p><p></p><p></p></div></h1></div><div class="col-1"></div><div class="col-6"><div class="img-introduction"><img class="img1_introduction" src="../img/chernivtsi4.jpg"></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="fact1" class="scroll-to"><div class="fact1"><div class="container"><div class="title_fact1"><div class="row"><div class="col-7"><div class="img-fact1"><img class="img1_fact1" src="../img/chernivtsi7.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-5"><h1><b>Tulip field</b></h1><div class="text_fact1"><br><br><p>Real tulip fields have been planted in the Chernivtsi region for several years in a row.

The theater was designed by Viennese architects F. Fellner and H. Helmer. His twin brother is located in Furt (Germany). The troupe of this theater went on tour to Chernivtsi in 2001. In 1907 a monument to Friedrich Schiller was erected in front of the Theater, and in 1980 - a monument to Olga Kobylyanskaya. The theater was named after her in 1954. To the right of the Theater you can see the building of the Higher State Educational Institution of Ukraine "Bukovynian State Medical University". This object became the original home for the heavenly patrons. From the facade of the building, built in 1912 as the Palace of Trade and Crafts, passers-by watch Demeter, the Goddess of Harvest and Fertility, and Hermes, God of Trade, Heraldry, Merchants, Commerce, Roads, Thieves, Deception, Sports, Travelers and Athletes, Emissary and messenger of the gods.<br><br></p><p></p></div></div><div class="col-6"><div class="img-fact2"><img class="img1_fact2" src="../img/chernivtsi8.jpg"></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="footer_row"><a href="#top"><img src="../img/up.png" width="20%"></a></div></div></footer></div></body></html>
